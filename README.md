# unspec-service 

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hmcts/unspec-service.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hmcts/unspec-service)

Civil Unspecified's CCD Callback Service.

### Contents:
- [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
- [Testing](#testing)
- [Building and deploying application](#building-and-deploying-the-application)
- [Camunda](#camunda)

## Prerequisites:
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com)
- [realpath-osx](https://github.com/harto/realpath-osx) (Mac OS only)
- [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/)

Run command:
```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

Add services, roles and users (in this order) from civil-unspecified-docker repository using scripts located in bin directory.

Load CCD definition:

CCD definition is stored in JSON format. To load it into CCD instance run:

```bash
$ ./bin/import-ccd-definition.sh
```

Note: Above script will export JSON content into XLSX file and upload it into instance of CCD definition store.

Additional note:

You can skip some of the files by using -e option on the import-ccd-definitions, i.e.

```bash
$ ./bin/import-ccd-definition.sh -e UserProfile.json,*-nonprod.json
```

The command above will skip UserProfile.json and all files with -nonprod suffix (from the folders).

## Testing
The repo uses codeceptjs framework for e2e tests.

To install dependencies enter `yarn install`.

To run e2e tests enter `yarn test` in the command line.

### Optional configuration

To run tests with browser window open set `SHOW_BROWSER_WINDOW=true`. By default, the browser window is hidden.

### Smoke test

To run smoke tests enter `yarn test:smoke`.

### API test

To run API tests enter `yarn test:api`.

### Pact or contract testing

#### Run and generate pact

You can run contract or pact tests as follows:

```
./gradlew contract
```
#### Run pact broker local docker
You can then publish your pact tests locally by first running the pact docker-compose:

```
docker-compose -f docker-pactbroker-compose.yml up -d
```
#### Publish pact to broker
and then using it to publish your tests:

```
./gradlew pactPublish
```
if you want to publish the pact to hmcts pact broker, please set this env variable accordingly before running the publish command.
```
export PACT_BROKER_FULL_URL=http://pact-broker.platform.hmcts.net/
./gradlew pactPublish
```

## Building and deploying the application

### Building the application

The project uses [Gradle](https://gradle.org) as a build tool. It already contains
`./gradlew` wrapper script, so there's no need to install gradle.

To build the project execute the following command:

```bash
  ./gradlew build
```

### Running the application

Create the image of the application by executing the following command:

```bash
  ./gradlew assemble
```

Create docker image:

```bash
  docker-compose build
```

Run the distribution (created in `build/install/unspec-service` directory)
by executing the following command:

```bash
  docker-compose up
```

This will start the API container exposing the application's port
(set to `4000` in this template app).

In order to test if the application is up, you can call its health endpoint:

```bash
  curl http://localhost:4000/health
```

You should get a response similar to this:

```
  {"status":"UP","diskSpace":{"status":"UP","total":249644974080,"free":137188298752,"threshold":10485760}}
```

### Alternative script to run application

To skip all the setting up and building, just execute the following command:

```bash
./bin/run-in-docker.sh
```

For more information:

```bash
./bin/run-in-docker.sh -h
```

Script includes bare minimum environment variables necessary to start api instance. Whenever any variable is changed or any other script regarding docker image/container build, the suggested way to ensure all is cleaned up properly is by this command:

```bash
docker-compose rm
```

It clears stopped containers correctly. Might consider removing clutter of images too, especially the ones fiddled with:

```bash
docker images

docker image rm <image-id>
```

There is no need to remove postgres and java or similar core images.

## Camunda

Camunda UI runs on `http:localhost:9404`. You can login with:
```$xslt
username: demo
password: demo
```

The REST API is available at `http:localhost:9404/engine-rest/`. The REST API documentation is available [here](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/latest/reference/rest/).

To upload all bpmn diagrams via the REST API there is a script located in `./bin directory`.
Run `./bin/import-bpmn-diagram.sh .` to upload it to Camunda. The diagram must exist within
`src/main/resources/camunda`. By setting `CAMUNDA_BASE_URL` env variable you can also use this script to upload diagrams to
Camunda in other environments.
